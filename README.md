# Styling changes as follows:
- Selected lettering is highlighted green instead of blue.
- Font is changed from "Montserrat" to "Source Sans Pro".
- Selected lettering slides down from the top. 
- When more than one character is revealed, there is a stepping delay to ease the slide in of each character.
